# Copy Examples: Good vs Bad

Real examples of effective and ineffective SaaS copywriting.

## Headlines

### Bad Headlines

```
"MCP Server for WHMCS"
```
- Just a product name
- No benefit or outcome
- Doesn't answer "why should I care?"

```
"The Best AI Integration Module"
```
- Vague superlative ("best")
- No proof or specificity
- Every competitor says "best"

```
"Powerful Analytics Dashboard"
```
- "Powerful" means nothing
- Feature, not benefit
- Doesn't solve a problem

### Good Headlines

```
"Cut WHMCS Admin Time in Half with AI"
```
- Specific outcome (half the time)
- Clear benefit (save time)
- Target audience knows it's for them

```
"Know Your Profit Per Client. Finally."
```
- Addresses specific pain point
- Emotional word ("Finally")
- Creates curiosity

```
"28 WHMCS Tasks You'll Never Do Manually Again"
```
- Specific number
- Clear transformation
- Implies ease/automation

---

## Subheadlines

### Bad

```
"A comprehensive solution for hosting providers"
```
- "Comprehensive" is meaningless

### Good

```
"Connect Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant to your billing system.
Query clients, invoices, and tickets using plain English."
```

## CTAs

### Bad CTAs

```
"Submit"
```
- Generic, cold
- No indication of what happens next

```
"Click Here"
```
- Tells action, not benefit
- Doesn't motivate

```
"Buy Now"
```
- Transaction-focused
- Missing the value

### Good CTAs

```
- Action + benefit

```
"Get Revenue Insights Now"
```
- Benefit-focused

```

### Bad

```
"MX Metrics is a powerful analytics module that provides
comprehensive revenue tracking capabilities for your WHMCS."
```
Problems:
- "Powerful" and "comprehensive" are filler

```
"Stop guessing your profit. Start knowing it.

MX Metrics shows your MRR, ARR, and net profit directly on your
WHMCS dashboard. Identify your VIP clients. Spot unprofitable
accounts. Make decisions backed by real data—not spreadsheets."
```
Why it works:
- Opens with transformation
- Specific metrics named

## Page Sections: Real Examples

### Basecamp (PAS Excellence)

**Problem:** "Leave the grind behind."

**Agitate:** "It's a struggle to juggle people, projects, clients,
deadlines, and expectations—especially when you're the underdog
competing against larger companies."

**Solution:** "We're like you, we get it."

### Stripe (Specificity)

to accept payments, send payouts, automate financial processes,
and ultimately grow revenue."
