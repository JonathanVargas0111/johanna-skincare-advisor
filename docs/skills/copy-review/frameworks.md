## BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)

**Before → After → Bridge**

Best for: Hero sections, email subject lines, short copy

### Structure

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Before | Current painful state | "Spreadsheets everywhere. No visibility into profit." |
| After | Desired future state | "Know your exact MRR, ARR, and profit per client." |
| Bridge | Your product connects them | "MX Metrics bridges the gap in 5 minutes." |

### Why BAB Works

- Focuses on transformation (emotional)
- Before/After creates contrast
- Bridge positions product as the path

### BAB vs PAS

| BAB | PAS |
|-----|-----|
| Positive framing | Problem framing |
| Shows future state | Agitates pain |
| Aspirational | Fear-based urgency |

Use BAB when your audience is solution-aware. Use PAS when they need to feel the pain first.

| **Features** | Specific elements that enable this | "5 dashboard widgets, cost tracking" |
| **Benefits** | Immediate, guaranteed outcomes | "Know your exact profit in 5 minutes" |

## Product Visibility Checklist

**"Most SaaS pages fail because they hide the product"**

| Check | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| Screenshot in hero | Users need to see what they're getting |
| Demo/video available | Reduces "will this work for me?" objection |
| Outcome shown first | Action > theory |
| UI visible before pricing | Build desire before asking for money |
